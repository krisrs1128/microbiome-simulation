# Semi-Synthetic Data for Microbiome Analysis

This repository contains source code for the examples discussed in our [review article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaf051) on how simulation can support microbiome analysis. The examples are collected into an [online tutorial](https://krisrs1128.github.io/microbiome-simulation/), which also gives some additional background and details for each example. Please post an issue or [get in touch](https://krisrs1128.github.io/LSLab/_includes/contact) if you have any questions.
